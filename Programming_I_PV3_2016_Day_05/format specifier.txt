format specifier
================
Method printf’s first argument is a format string that may consist of fixed text and format specifiers. Fixed text is output by printf just as it would be by print or println. Each format specifier is a placeholder for a value and specifies the type of data to output. Format specifiers also may include optional formatting information.

Format specifiers begin with a percent sign (%) followed by a character that represents the data type. For example, the format specifier %s is a placeholder for a string.
