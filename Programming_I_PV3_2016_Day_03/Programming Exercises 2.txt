PROGRAMMING EXERCISES 2
========================

1. Write a program that produces the following output:
**********************************
* Programming Exercises 2 *
* Programming I *
* Author: Your Name *
* Due Date: Current Date *
**********************************



2. Consider the following program segment:
//import classes
public class Exercise2
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
	   //variable declaration
	   //executable statements
	}
}


a. Write Java statements that declare the following variables: num1, num2, and num3, and average of type int.
b. Write Java statements that store 125 into num1, 28 into num2, and -25 into num3.
c. Write a Java statement that stores the average of num1, num2, and num3 into average.
d. Write Java statements that output the values of num1, num2, num3, and average.
e. Compile and run your program.


3. Repeat Exercise 2 by declaring num1, num2, and num3, and average of type double. Store 75.35 into num1, -35.56 into num2, and 15.76 into num3.


5. Consider the following Java program in which the statements are in the incorrect order. Rearrange the statements so that it prompts the user to input the length and width of a rectangle and output the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

public class Ch2_PrExercise5
{
	static Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
	import java.util.*;
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		int width;

		System.out.print("Enter the length: ");
		width = console.nextInt();
		System.out.println();
		int length;

		System.out.print("Enter the width: ");
		length = console.nextInt();

		System.out.println();

		area = length * width;

		System.out.println("Area = " + area);
		System.out.println("Perimeter = " + perimeter);
		perimeter = 2 * (length + width);

		int area;
		int perimeter;
	}
}


6. Write a program that prompts the user to input a decimal number and outputs the number rounded to the nearest integer.


7. Write a program that prompts the user to enter five test scores and then prints the average test score.


8. Write a program that prompts the user to input five decimal numbers. The program should then add the five decimal numbers, convert the sum to the
nearest integer, and print the result.


9. Write a program that does the following:
	a. Prompts the user to input five decimal numbers
	b. Prints the five decimal numbers
	c. Converts each decimal number to the nearest integer
	d. Adds the five integers
	e. Prints the sum and average of the five integers



11. Write a Java program that prompts the user to input the elapsed time for an event in seconds. The program then outputs the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. (For example, if the elapsed time is 9630 seconds, then the output is 2:40:30.)
